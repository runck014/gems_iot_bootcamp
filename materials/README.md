# Bill of Materials for Workshop

The bill of materials are required for each group in the workshop. Each group
gets:
- 1 node with 3 sensors
- 6 extra sensors for node
- 1 gateway
- 1 web sever
- 1 database

Total cost per group: $xxxx

In order to reduce the burden of procuring materials, we work with the open
source company Northern Widget who prepares each group's kit.
